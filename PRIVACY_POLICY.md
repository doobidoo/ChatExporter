# Privacy Policy for Chat Exporter

**Last Updated: March 19, 2025**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Chat Exporter ("we", "our", or "the extension") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our browser extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience when using our extension.

## Information Collection and Use

### Information We Do Not Collect

Chat Exporter is designed with privacy in mind. The extension:

- Does not collect any personal information
- Does not track your browsing history
- Does not store your conversations in any remote server
- Does not transmit any data to external servers
- Does not use analytics or tracking tools
- Does not use cookies or similar technologies

### Local Processing Only

All conversation exports are processed entirely locally on your device. When you click the "Export" button:

1. The extension accesses only the current active tab containing ChatGPT or Claude.ai
2. The content of the conversation is extracted directly from the page's DOM
3. The conversation is formatted as Markdown
4. The resulting file is saved directly to your computer through your browser's download functionality
5. No data is sent to our servers or any third-party servers

### Required Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: To access the content of the current tab when you click the extension icon
- **scripting**: To run content scripts that extract conversation data from ChatGPT and Claude.ai
- **downloads**: To save the exported Markdown file to your computer

These permissions are used solely for the purpose of extracting and saving your conversations and nothing else.

## Data Retention

Since Chat Exporter does not collect any data, there is no data retention policy. The only data saved is the Markdown file that is downloaded to your computer, which is entirely under your control.

## Third-Party Services

Chat Exporter does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or libraries that would collect or process your data.

## Children's Privacy

Chat Exporter does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. Since the extension does not collect any personal information at all, it is safe for users of all ages to use.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
